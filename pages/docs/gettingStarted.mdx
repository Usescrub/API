## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

To begin using the API:

1. **Sign up** at [usescrub.io](https://usescrub.io) to request an API key.
2. Use tools like **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or your preferred HTTP client.
3. Make POST/GET requests to the appropriate endpoint with the correct JSON payload.

In the authentication request, your app will utilize the client_credentials OAuth 2.0 flow.
Details on this flow can be found at [https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/)
Example request to `/verify-bvn`:

```http
POST /verify-bvn
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bvn": "22345678901"
}
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "full_name": "Adebola James",
  "phone_number": "08031234567"
}
```
